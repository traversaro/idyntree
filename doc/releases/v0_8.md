iDynTree 0.8 Release Notes
=========================

This is the first version of iDynTree for which a changelog was introduced. 

Important Changes
-----------------
* The iDynTree::Model class now supports prismatic joints, using the iDynTree::PrismaticJoint class. Support for prismatic joints was added also to the URDF parser ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/269 ). 

* The methods and constructors of the iDynTree::RevoluteJoint and iDynTreee::PrismaticJoint classes handling joints have been cleaned up ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/339 ).

### Dependencies

* The logic to enable/disable dependencies has changed. In particular, now all the dependencies (excluding the legacy dependency on KDL)
  that are found on the system are enabled. Users can still select manually the dependency that they want to compile using 
  the `IDYNTREE_USES_<dep>` variables ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/323 ).
* IPOPT has been added as an optional dependency for the Inverse Kinematics component.

### Bindings 

* The Octave bindings have been migrated to use the exact same mex code used for the Matlab bindings ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/305 ).
